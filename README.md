# Binder

A light-weight, macOS native image viewer.

## Why make Binder?
I stumbled across an app named [Art Book](https://github.com/xjbeta/Art-Book) but it was extremely outdated and had crashing problems, and due to that I thought it would be nice to write my own from the ground up and made for newer macOS versions.

**Whats the point**
Finder doesn't neccessarily have a good way of viewing images, and in my opinion what it currently does for its grid / preview doesnt do enough for me personally, so I thought of making an experience where the images are easy to view and easy to look at.

Though some people may not agree and may just use Finder anyway, but that's completely up to them.

## Installation
Go to the [releases](https://github.com/ssalggnikool/Binder/releases) page, and download the `.dmg` for your system.

## Build

1. Make sure you have create-dmg installed, using `npm install --global create-dmg`
    - Optional: `brew install graphicsmagick imagemagick`
      - This is for the simple volume icon, this is not needed but optional.

2. Run `make package`
